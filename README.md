# mylearningjourney
My note creation of what I am learning and the doubts I have.

I started learning the HTML from freecodecamp two days ago. So far I have learnt about

1 <h></h> - Heading
2 <p></p> - Paragraph
3 <main></main> - Though I dont know whats the purpose of main.
4 <!-- --> - To comment, the syntax is a bit different from the rest.

5. <img src="a.jpg"> There is no closing tag img element and src is a attribute (source) alt is another attribute, a must have for img.
<img src "=a.jpg" alt ="Letter A"> An attribute will have an equal to sign (my finding :)

6. Anchor Elements <a href = "www.a.com">links to letter site</a> href is an attribute and follows with a text. This is an example of anchor linking to external pages.
7. Anchor linking to internal pages.<a href="#Letter A">Letter A </a>
    <p> id="Letter A">Letter A</p> Links to within the page where the id is. # prefix to be used
8 target is an attribute,<a href="www.a.com"> Letter A target="blank"</a> Blank target opens the link in a new tab.
9 href="#" = Dead Links, I dont know what is meant by dead links
