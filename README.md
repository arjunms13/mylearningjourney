My note creation of what I am learning and the doubts I have.

radio buttons give the user the option to select only one answer.

radio buttons should be nested inside a label

the name of the radio buttons to be the same to create a radio button group
<label>
  <input type="radio"name="test">Day 1
</label>

A best practice is to include for in label

<label for="Day 1 ">
  <input id="Day 1" type="radio" name="test">Day 1
  </label>
  
  
 Checkboxes are to give multiple options.
The format is as of radio button

Starts with a label and for
input id,type,name

<label for="India">
  <input id="India" type="checkbox" name="Country">India
  </label>
