<!--Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.
text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.
text-align: center; centers the text
text-align: right; right-aligns the text
And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS.-->

img {
  width: 220px;
  height:25px;
  }
  
 <!--To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. 
 This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.-->

<!--To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember.
With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.-->

<!--To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. 
It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.-->
